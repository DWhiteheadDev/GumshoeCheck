# GumshoeCheck
GumshoeCheck is an accessibility checker GitHub App that manages incoming content and makes sure it meets accessibility guidelines. It performs automated checks on pull requests, issues, and comments, helping developers address accessibility concerns early in the development process. (Really just testing GitHub Apps, but don't mind me...)
